Long ago, there was an age of heroes,

00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,583
when the Avengers
kept the forces of darkness at bay.

6
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:29,041
Until, consumed by his fury,
the Hulk unleashed terrors

the likes of which
the world had never known.

It's more than a linear path.

It's a prism of endless possibility,

talkin' to someone?

00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
[Banner] Huh?

55
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,208
[The Watcher] Sam Wilson sought to help
the brilliant doctor

56
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:04,375
with a field of science
far different from his own.

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,041
It's the fear.

00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,750
The fear I see in everyone else's eyes.

61
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,208
And how does that make you feel?

62
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,875
[inhales sharply] Lonely.

63
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,583
Because if I'm being honest,

64
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:22,125
I'm just as scared of myself
as they are of me.

65
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:26,250
Well, look around you.
Ain't no one's afraid of you here, Bruce.

66
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,541
[The Watcher] Sam Wilson knew
he had a responsibility

67
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,333
to Banner as his counselor.

68
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,416
But in that moment,
he saw a man struggling

69
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,208
and felt he could do more to help him
as a friend.

Chicago and a dozen other major cities
were attacked by Gamma Beasts.

134

And more are emerging every hour.

136
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:48,208
This could be a wave triple the size
of the one we faced in the old Gamma War.

137

Yeah. And that one took out
all the Avengers.

The point is,
there's more of them this time, okay?

00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,458
But where are these beasts
even coming from?

a Gamma signature in the Arctic

as the original Apex beast.

150

We need to get Bruce Banner on this.

No.

Now, the rest of you,

You do not get that lucky twice.

163

You really think Banner's a better bet?

00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,958
I mean, this all started with him.
Maybe he can finish it.

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,708

he lives in a lair
in the center of an active volcano.
